KCH is a tertiary 800-bed-hospital administered by the Ministry of Health. It serves as a teaching hospital and as a referral hospital for central Malawi with a catchment population of around 6 million. The medical department has a bed capacity of around 90 and runs daily outpatientâ€™s clinics, an admitting ward and is further responsible for the tuberculosis ward off campus.
In Malawi, the College of Medicine (CoM) provides full medical training since 1991. Currently, there are about forty new medical doctors graduating per year, whereby first-year intake numbers are gradually increased. Graduates intern at a hospital, rotating through departments. After the internship, the majority works in the Malawian public sector.
